This script allows you to synchronize a Google Spreadsheet with Webflow using the Webflow API. It provides a seamless integration between the powerful features of Google Spreadsheet and the flexibility of Webflow, enabling you to automate the process of updating content on your Webflow website from a spreadsheet.

Features

- Sync data between Google Spreadsheet and Webflow
- Update content on your Webflow site from a centralized spreadsheet
- Automate data entry without manual intervention

How It Works

The Webflow-Spreadsheet Sync Script uses the Webflow API to interact with your Webflow projects and the Google Spreadsheet API to access and modify data in your CMS. It allows you to define mappings between the columns in your spreadsheet and the fields in your Webflow CMS, making it easy to keep your data in sync.

By running this script on a scheduled basis or triggering it manually, you can ensure that the content on your Webflow site is always up to date with the latest data from your Google Spreadsheet.
